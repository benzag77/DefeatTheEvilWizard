# Defeat the Evil Wizard

## Overview
This project is a turn-based battle game where the player creates a hero character to battle the powerful Evil Wizard. The game demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create a dynamic and interactive gameplay experience. Players can attack, heal, use special abilities, and view stats to strategize and win the battle.
